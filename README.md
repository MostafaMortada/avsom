## SANCTUARY OF THE LUNAR RUNE

THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT

I REPEAT

THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE PROJECT

THIS IS STILL IN PROGRESS

---

A roguelike game written in Lua

Run the `run.sh` script to start the game.

**Dependencies:** `lua` and `bash`. Should work on most systems if those 2 are present.

## Controls

### warning: as of now like half the controls don't do anything

*All keybinds in this section refer to the default configuration.*

Anytime you give directional input, you can use these two schemes...
